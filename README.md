# Let's compost IT!

Bio waste is organic waste generated in our homes from food or plant residues, which undergo a natural process of degradation (biodegradation). The selected organic residues can be used to produce compost that increases soil fertility or biogas that can be used to generate energy. Potential is huge, but there are many challenes on the way. That is why Malopolska Region is asking you to join the forces to spread the idea of using the home- composter and benefits of bio-waste segregation.
